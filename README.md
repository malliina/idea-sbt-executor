# SBT Executor #

This is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that adds a menu to execute Simple Build Tool (SBT) commands.

Define your favorite commands under Project Settings -> SBT Executor.

## Java 7 ##

This plugin uses Java 7 APIs, so ensure that IntelliJ IDEA runs on a Java 7 or higher JDK.

Check the JDK version under Help -> About (on Windows.)

### Roadmap ###

Depend on [idea-sbt-plugin](https://github.com/orfjackal/idea-sbt-plugin) for settings.
